# GLSL Shader Experiments

**Author:** Jacob Coenen

A collection of fragment shaders written in GLSL. This repo serves as my personal playground for learning GLSL.

## `FirstShader.frag`

**Created using:** [The Book of Shaders Editor](http://editor.thebookofshaders.com)

A basic fragment shader that blends animated color changes relative to both mouse position and time. It demonstrates:

- Normalized screen coordinates
- Time-based color oscillation
- Interactive response to mouse position

## `AnimatedRGBMouseGlow.frag`

**Created using:** [The Book of Shaders Editor](http://editor.thebookofshaders.com)
 
 A GLSL fragment shader that renders a dynamic RGB gradient
 background with a pulsing red glow centered on the mouse position.
